# === DESCRIPTION ===

# Given an int n, return the absolute difference between n and 21, except return double the absolute difference if n is over 21.


# diff21(19) → 2
# diff21(10) → 11
# diff21(21) → 0

# === MY SOLUTION ===

def diff21(n):
  if n < 0:
    n = 21 - n
  elif n > 21:
    n = 2*(n - 21)
  else:
    n = 21 - abs(n)
  return n
