# === DESCRIPTION ===

# You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. 
# Write code to compute the result, encoded as an int value: 
# 0=no ticket, 1=small ticket, 2=big ticket. 
# If speed is 60 or less, the result is 0. 
# If speed is between 61 and 80 inclusive, the result is 1. 
# If speed is 81 or more, the result is 2. 
# Unless it is your birthday -- on that day, your speed can be 5 higher in all cases.

# caught_speeding(60, False) → 0
# caught_speeding(65, False) → 1
# caught_speeding(65, True) → 0

# === MY SOLUTION ===

def caught_speeding(speed, is_birthday):
  limit60 = 60
  limit80 = 80
  if is_birthday:
    limit60 = limit60 + 5
    limit80 = limit80 + 5
  if speed <= limit60:
    return 0
  elif speed>limit60 and speed<=limit80:
    return 1
  else:
    return 2
